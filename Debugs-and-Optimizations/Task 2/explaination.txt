The given code fails for maximum d elements when a[0] <= b[0] < a[1] and there's atleast one pair of a[i] != b[i] 
for ((i >= 1) and (n >= 3)), which gives output of max d for element at index 0 = b[max]-a[0], instead of b[0] - a[0].

We need to change the approach for max d elements by 
for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
        small[i] = (b[b.size()-1] - a[i]);
        if(i==(lower_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), a[i]) - b.begin())){
            b.erase(b.begin()+i, b.end());
        }
