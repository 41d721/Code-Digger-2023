The main concept used in this problem is Dynamic Programming (DP) to calculate the maximum calories burnt in a grid.The function maxCaloriesBurnt takes this grid as input along with its dimensions and returns the maximum total calories that can be burnt.

The time complexity of the given code is O(nm), where n and m are the dimensions of the grid.
