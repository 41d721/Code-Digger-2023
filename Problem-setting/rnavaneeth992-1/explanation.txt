Array Construction Logic:

Loop through all possible common differences (d) between array elements.
Check if the common difference is a divisor of the difference between y and x.
Calculate the starting point (p) of the array based on the common difference.
Check if the array can be constructed within the given conditions (sorted and maximum element minimized).
Calculate the sum of the array elements with the minimum maximum element.
Update the answer if the current configuration is better.
