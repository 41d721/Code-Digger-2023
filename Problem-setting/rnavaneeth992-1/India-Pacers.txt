India-Pacers.txt

In the World Cup 23, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, and Mohammed Siraj, the trio of India Pace Attack is unstoppable. 
The variation in the speed, swing and the bounce make them unpredictable. The batsmen are struggling to face the attack.
But the cricket analyst of australia team, after analysing the pacers' speed identified some patterns in order 
to construct the array of bowling speed to predict the speed at which they bowl. There is a junior analyst in Australia Cricket Team, 
his job is to contruct the array from the given pattern to help his batters assess the speed at which they bowl.


Karthik, the cricket analyst revealed his findings as follows

- The array consists of n strictly distinct positive integers, each integer corresponding to each delivery of the India fielding innings of the match
- The array always consists of the two elements a and b such that a is strictly less than b
- If the array is sorted in ascending order, then the difference between all the neighboring elements are equal (x2-x1=x3-x2=...=xn-xn-1)

But yeah, you are right if you think that multiple arrays may exist satisfying these conditions. 
But after recognising the pace of the bowlers, they noticed that india team always chose that 
one array which is always sorted and the maximum element is always minimised.

Input Format:
First line of the input contains t, representing the number of testcases
For each of the testcases, the only line consists of three integers n, a and b, where 
n represents the number of deliveries in the match (number of balls)
a and b are the two elements that are always present in the array

Output format:
For each test case, print the required array which has the properties that satisifes the pattern, sorted and the maximum element is minimised

Constraints
2 <= n <= 100
1 <= a < b <= 10**5
