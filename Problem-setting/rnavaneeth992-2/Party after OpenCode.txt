Party after OpenCode

After OpenCode 23, contributors requested a party from IIITA. 
This request was individually made by each of the n gangs present in all contributors. 
So what happened was the i-th gang, which consists of s friends, travelled in the car, 
which could take atmost 4 contributors, to the party. What would have been the minimum number
of Cars required such that all members of the same gang travelled in the same Cars, 
but each Car could take more than one gang?

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains n, the number of gangs of contributors.
The second line contains a sequence of integers s1,s2,s3,...sn. 
The integers are separated by a space, s is the number of contributors in the i-th gang.

Output format:
Print the single number — the minimum number of Cars necessary to drive all contributors to the party.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10**5
1 ≤ s ≤ 4
