The given rules are divisibility rules/checks for divisibility of a number by 7.
(It can also be observed that all si are divisble by 7 and are multiples of 7)
Thus, s0 is first 4 digit number divisible by 7 (1001)
s1 = 1001 + 7
si = 1001 + (7*i)
Array is filled using for loop
Digit Sum is calculated and stored for each si
Divisibility of the digit sums is checked against each n[i] and output is generated.
