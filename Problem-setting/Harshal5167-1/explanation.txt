Explanation:

if topHeights[i]+bottomHeights[i]==k then it is not possible for the plane to cross this is easy to see.
But the main problem is when topHeights[i]+bottomHeights[i]==k is satisfied but (k-(max{bottomHeights[i],bottomHeights[i+1],bottomHeights[i-1]}+1) < topHeights[i]) is not satisfied. As the plane will have no space to go through in that case. 
So we have to check both of these cases to find whether it can cross or not.
