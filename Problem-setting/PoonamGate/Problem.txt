Second line contains n space seperated integer (amount in the each bank).
third line contains no of queries q.each query contain one line.
first line contain require 'T' fund.

output format: space sperated integers whose sum is equal to T(subset of bank amount)


Constraints:
t<=1e4
T<=1e4
n<=100
xi<=1e4
q<=1e4;
(here no choices of rob fraction amount of xi )
