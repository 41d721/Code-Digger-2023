ALice gave bob two number he have to simply add them output the sum.

BUT....

Thier is a catch Alice does a mishief, Before giving those number as input she has reversed number so now for bob to calculate sum he has to first reverse those number and then add them Now Bob also decided to do a mischeif he also outputs reversed sum. Help Bob to calculate sum.

NOTE :- if after reversing, number contains leading zero remove them and output Sum For example reverse of 700 is 7 or 6400 is 46.  

**INPUT FORMAT:**

The First line of input is an integer **T**. The number of the test case.

Each test case contains two integer **a** and **b**.

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:</br>
For each test case output required sum.

**SAMPLE INPUT**:</br>
3</br>
24 1</br>
4358 754</br>
305 794</br>

**OUTPUT**:</br>
