**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

John is fond of squares of numbers and aims to represent any positive integer as a sum of squares.
Now, he wants to minimize the number of squares that need to be added to make a particular number. 
Help him find the minimum number of squares that have to be added to get the sum n.

For example:

8 = 2^2 + 2^2 (output = 2)

11 = 3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 (output = 3)

* you have to solve this question using dynaminc programming

**INPUT FORMAT**

first line contain integer t - number of test cases

next t lines contain a integer **n**


**OUTPUT FORMAT**

minimum number of squares that have to be added to get the sum **n**
